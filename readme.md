# Flexible Posts Widget Templates

I often turn to the plugin [Flexible Posts Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-posts-widget/ "Flexible Posts Widget in the WordPress.org plugin directory") for its ability to display posts chosen at random or selections within categories or of custom post types. FPW comes with a display template that shows the title, linking to the full entry, but I virtually never use it. Instead, I've developed a collection of templates with various content. Feel free to use these: put the templates you want into a subfolder of your theme folder called "flexible-posts-widget".

All templates support the inclusion of featured images, which appear before the rest of the content as they do in the included templates.

### Full Content, No Title

I use this template to display items like testimonials, where the full content is short and not intended to be displayed solo. There is no linking in this template, even if a thumbnail is included.

### Title, Excerpt[, Read More Button or Link]

In all three title and excerpt templates the title and featured image, if used, link to the full content. The two with additional links are are identical except for the markup of the words "read more". In one case they are on a button with the class "read-more-button" and in the other they are in a span with the class "read-more-link".

### Title Only

This just the "default" template included but given a more descriptive name.
